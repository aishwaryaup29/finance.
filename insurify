Insurify: Overview
What prompted the development of this platform?
Insurance came into picture in earlier times as a way for communities to pool resources in order to protect each other from shared risks.The productiveness of this approach iincreased with more participation, as large number made the statistics more dependable.Nonetheless, due to its reliance on trust,this solution couldn't be scaled effectively.As a consequence , conventional insurance industry were established.
In response to the unexpected rise of scams in Decentralized Finance (DeFi),we recognized an opportunity to combine our knowledge of the insurance sector with our enthusiasm for decentralized technology. We realized that it was feasible to establish a secure domain within an expandable environment, where users would only need to have faith in the technology itself, rather than placing trust in all participants.
Our objective is to provide our members effortless, translucent, convenient, and cost-effective financial protection against thier risk.
What is Insurify Finance?
Insurify Finance stand as a decentralized alternative to insurance.By implementing blockchain technology,we begin a pool for sharing risks,reinstating individual control over assets.The platform operates across multiple chain and is built on Etherchain smart Chain.It permits anyone to purchase insurance.Apart from that, they also provide opportunity to engage in a form of governance, stimulating active participation.
Where is our community?
We greatly value communication with our community members and are committed to addressing their inquiries. Our development team and community members employ the following social media channels:
$IF Token
Our cryptocurrency
What's the purpose of having a token?
Our cryptocurrency serves as a form of money that enables the acquisition of coverage and participation in our governance,along with additional utility through partnership.The token act as as asset based on the Binance Smart Chain, which  can experience fluctuations in its valuation (a common occurrence for all cryptocurrency tokens on the blockchain).
How to Buy?
You can acquire $IF through our Dapp ( +++++ ) or by using the Uniswap Swap at ( +++++ ) with wallets like Metamask or Trust Wallet.
Purchasing $IF Tokens
Acquiring Insurance
How Can I Obtain $IF?
Individuals holding a Metamask account have the option to purchase $IF via the application interface.
The process has been as simply as possible:
Select the whitelisted smart contract address for which you want insurance.
The IF Period, IF Amount, and Currency (USDT or IF) must all be specified.
Create a quote with Metamask, then complete the transaction.
You are now secured!
You can buy IF with ETH or USDT.
If you use ETH or USDT to make your payment, the system will automatically convert it to $IF in the background and use that money to immediately purchase insurance.
When making payment in ETH or USDT, the system will automatically convert your contribution to $IF in the background. This converted IF will then be used to promptly acquire insurance.
If the purchased coverage is in $IF it will entitle you to benefits like reudced prices for insurance and enhanced token utility through collaborations such as staking.
If I purchase multiple policies for assets kept in one wallet, will I still be protected?
No, you won't be covered if you buy a single policy from your whitelisted account to cover assets distributed from multiple wallets and lose money.
For Protocol coverage, in conjunction with various other factors, your overall loss must be at least 90% or more (a substantial liquidity loss). Consequently, you must submit evidence of loss for each wallet, along with the associated Claim ID, to demonstrate the funds you've lost. The evidence of loss and the connected Claims ID for your wallets will be accessible to claim evaluators
How is the cost of the policy determined?
The cost of the policy id entirely determined on risk rating percentage associated with  the asset you intend to insure.
The amount of your desired insurance coverage and the duration of the coverage are also factors in determining the cost of insurance (single coverage).
 Keeping $IF
What if I experience financial loss two days before my protection ends? Is the 48-hour Protocol Cover cool-down period required of me?
You would need to buy coverage on our Dapp for a specific amount of time if you wanted to keep coverage for your assets.
It is possible to submit a claim for a significant loss of funds that took place within the coverage period specified by the policy. IF Holders have a window of 14 days following the expiration of their coverage to initiate a claim. Claims cannot be initiated once this 14-day period has lapsed.
Please be aware that losses occurring after the policy's expiration date are not eligible for coverage. Claims can only be made for losses that occurred while the insurance policy was active.
Is there an option to transfer or sell coverage to another individual if I no longer require it?
No, Insurify Finance does not permit policyholders to transfer their insurance coverage to someone else.
What would be the duration of the Claims Assessment Process?
The timeline for the Claims  Assessment process pivot on the volume of claims and the number of individuals involved. Nonetheless, our aim is to review claims within 48 hours after the said claim is submitted.
How is the result of a claim determined?
Claim Assessors will function as arbitrators, and their decision will determine the outcome of each claim. For more information, please refer to the Documents page.
When is the loss of funds in USDT or IF determined for a claim?
A $IF holder has the ability to submit a claim when they sustain a significant loss that meets the norm for compensation. During the Claims Assessment process, Claims Assessors will review a claim and determine if it satisfies the requirements stated in the relevant cover language.
The value of the liquidity just before to the rug's occurrence is cited by Claims Assessors when talking about the worth of the lost cash.
In the event that a claim payout is approved by the claims assessment procedure, the cover holder will receive a payout. (Note: The refund must be made in the same currency in which the user originally bought the insurance. This applies primarily to single coverage)
Risk Evaluation Process
While determining the risk level of an asset as low, medium,high, the risk management process considers a range of factors.The factors impacting the assessment are as follows:
The networkon on which the asset is situated.
The overall liquidity of the asset in question.
The collective strength of the community and team supporting the asset.
The tokenomics and business framework associated with the asset.
The outlined roadmap and whitepaper detailing the asset's plans.
Once a comprehensive review of the aforementioned factors has been conducted, a risk rating will be assigned to the asset, classifying it as low, medium, or high risk. Subsequently, this rating will be used to determine the cost and prerequisites for obtaining coverage for the specific asset.
Assurance of security and audits
No audits have been performed as of the time this article was written. We intend to have reputable auditing companies examine our contracts. In June, the auditing process will start.
Our top objective is to properly proofread every line of code as part of our insurance routine to look for any potential vulnerabilities or flaws. Auditing companies and a number of designated, highly qualified team members will perform several proofreading sessions for both our Decentralized application and smart contract. We as a project won't accept anything less than extraordinary in every way.
Participation and Governance
Empowering the Community:
Our vision for Insurify revolves around community involvement. This entails establishing an active forum and implementing a voting mechanism to make decisions about the protocol's direction. Token holders will possess the ability to influence the path Insurify takes in its future endeavors.
Insurify Governance Forum:
The governance forum will serve as a central platform where the community can engage in discussions covering a wide array of topics. This platform aims not only to enhance user interaction but also to facilitate the sharing of experiences related to fraudulent tokens and instances of 'Rugpulls' encountered in the past.
Community Voting in Insurify:
The community voting system is of paramount importance to our project's approach. We firmly believe that the users who opt to utilize our services should have a role in steering the project's trajectory to a certain extent. The polls may range from minor decisions to significant determinations. It's important to note that the core team retains the prerogative to modify or revise a poll after its submission, in cases where new circumstances regarding the issue arise or for valid reasons.

How to Purchase Coverage
A Comprehensive Guide for Members
Advantages of Coverage
Given the rise in DeFi's prominence, the prevalence of Rug-pulls and fraudulent tokens has become unacceptably high. Acquiring coverage for your assets is a paramount way to safeguard your initial investment and mitigate risks when dealing with more precarious assets.
Chain Analysis
Key Considerations When Procuring Coverage
After you've determined the assets you wish to insure, take the following aspects into account:
What duration of coverage is suitable for your needs? Our coverage policy offers timeframes ranging from a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 365 days.
What payment denomination aligns with your preferences?
Which currency do you intend to use to pay for your policy? When purchasing coverage, you can choose between USDT or ISR. Consider which currency best suits your payment preference. (The currency utilized for acquiring coverage will also be the currency for claim payouts.)
NOTE: In the event of an accepted claim, it may take up to 48 hours for funds to be distributed.
Purchasing Insurify Coverage
To obtain coverage for an asset/token, follow these steps:
Enter the address of the token you want coverage for.
Specify the coverage amount, duration, and currency (ISR or USDT) for your policy. (Remember, the currency you use to purchase coverage is the currency you will receive as payout.)
Generate a quotation.
You can buy coverage using ISR or USDT by confirming the transaction through your MetaMask wallet or equivalent.
Once coverage is purchased, the total amount in ISR will be placed into the treasury. There's a possibility that up to 50% of the reserved ISR for coverage purchase may be staked post-filing.
How to Initiate a Claim
A Comprehensive Guide for Members
When to File a Claim

Claim Limit per Cover Policy
When ready to file a claim, ensure that the loss adheres to our coverage policies and qualifies for reimbursement.
Potential Claim Outcomes
Two possible outcomes exist for claims:
If Claims Assessors approve your claim, you will receive a payout in BUSD or RGMT equivalent to the loss. (Based on your initial payment)
If your claim is rejected by Claims Assessors, you won't receive a payout. However, for each declined case, you have the option to dispute the decision if you believe it was inaccurately assessed. A new assessor will be assigned to review the dispute.
Understanding Insurify Finance
Insight into Cover Pricing
Coverage pricing is exclusively determined by the risk assessment of the asset, along with the coverage period and amount requested by the user. Detailed pricing information for individual coverage will be displayed within the Dapp, alongside the asset you're seeking coverage for. Insurify reserves the right to adjust coverage pricing based on the overall treasury and holdings, ensuring sustainability.
Capacity Restriction
Capacity limits are established to mitigate overreliance on specific risks, safeguarding the overall stability of Insurify. Two restrictions apply:
Singular Risk Limit: Depending on the extent of risk you're willing to undertake for a specific asset.
Global Capacity Limit: Corresponding to the cumulative treasury assets of Insurify.
Both limits are considered during coverage determination.
Claim Submissions
Claim initiation is the initial step in the claims process. If the claim is accepted, a percentage calculated by the network and token is deducted, and the remaining deposit is returned. A 48-hour window after the initial claim allows members to dispute the claim once. If the dispute is also rejected, you'll have one more claim left without a second dispute.
